            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>There is a third ſort who liue in his Church, and this is the higheſt ſocietie in this life, and here we ſhall ſee policie, juſtice, frugalitie, and all vertues, becauſe Gods worſhip is here, and as the inferior faculties of the ſoule are

<pb facs="tcp:177234:4"/> not to liue like beaſts; but if they come to the ſecond ſocietie, to liue like civill men, that doth content them; they giue GOD thankes (perhaps) for this, that they are men and not beaſts, and that they haue beene bred civilly, but few giue God thankes for this, that they liue under the Goſpell, where they may learne Chriſt, <hi>not many Noble are called.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> Sometimes they may tremble and feare, as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 24. 25.</note> did, and put off their converſion to another<note place="margin">Act 26. 28.</note> time, and ſome of them are like <hi>Agrippa,</hi> who almoſt are perſwaded to be Chriſtians; but<note place="margin">Act. 13. 7.</note> few like <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> who was converted at <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching.</p>

            <p>The ſecond ſort of Determination is <hi>Iuris humani,</hi> when men determinate, where there is no expreſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, as concerning circumſtances, time, places, perſons, and ſuch. God commandeth in his law, that they ſhould pay their firſt fruits, but he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not how much they ſhould pay of their firſt fruits; then the Prieſts come in with their humane determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the moſt ſhall giue no more than one of fiftie, and the leaſt ſhall giue no leſſe than one of ſixtie.

            <p>Secondly, Humane Lawes doe prohibite and forbid; ſo doe theſe Iudiciall Lawes, and there are moe of them which are Negatiues than Affirmatiues, to ſhew us the perverſe nature of man.</p>

When a man offered a Beaſt vnto the Lord which he had vowed, he might not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; this was commanded onely for eſchewing of greater evill; for if it had beene lawfull to change once, a good in place of a bad one, then they would haue come quickly to this, to haue changed a bad for a good: So this Law permitted divorcement for the hardneſſe of the peoples hearts, and for the eſchewing of greater inconvenience, leaſt hard-hearted men ſhould haue killed their wiues.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the puniſhments inflicted by humane lawes<note place="margin">The puniſhments of the Iudiciall Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable.</note> are alterable: ſo were the puniſhments in <hi>Moſes</hi> Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Law; therefore the <hi>Iewes</hi> ſay of them, <hi>aſcendunt &amp; deſcendunt,</hi> which they vnderſtand, not of the greateſt and higheſt tranſgreſſions, but <hi>praecepta media,</hi> their middle Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts did forbid.

            <p>The Scripture compareth the morall Law to a priſon, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 22. the Ceremoniall Law to a ſecond Ward, and theſe Iudiciall Lawes to a Iailor, to keepe the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in cloſe priſon that none of them breake out.</p>

               <p>There were foure Kings anointed at the firſt with common Oyle, called the Oyle of <hi>Balſom;</hi> but not with holy Oyle.

                  </label> with the ſame oyle, yet the Prieſt is forbidden eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to lament for the dead, becauſe he was a more vive type of Chriſt than the King was; and concerning <hi>Davids</hi> mourning after the Beere; <hi>R: Iudah</hi> anſwereth,<note place="margin">Why the high Prieſt might not mourne for the dead.</note> that <hi>David</hi> did this to purge himſelfe, that he was not guiltie of the bloud of <hi>Abner:</hi> and the Text ſaith, <hi>that the people and all Iſrael underſtood that day, that it was not</hi>

               <p>Now the reaſons proving that they were both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed with the ſame ſort of Oyle are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the Oyle wherewith the Kings were anointed, <label type="milestone">

               <p>But there was none of this ſort of Oyle in the ſecond <label type="milestone">

               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:177234:26"/>
               <p>Although there was no materiall oyle in the ſecond Temple, wherewith they anointed the King and Prieſt, yet the ſpirituall anointing was figured here, by the compariſon taken from the anointing in the Temple.

               <p>Thirdly, the King was in dignitie aboue the high <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>3</label> Prieſt, but onely when the Prieſt asked counſell at the Lord for him, the high Prieſt ſtood when the King ſate in the houſe of the Lord, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 18. Is it probable then that he was anointed with an inferiour ſort of oyle to that wherewith the Prieſt was anointed?</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177234:28"/> the very ſame words which are in the interdiction, did <hi>Hezekias</hi> gather his riches contrary to the law here?

                  <hi>Salomon</hi> is cenſured by the Holy Ghoſt, not that he had utterly forſaken God, but that he went not fully after the Lord; or that his heart was not perfect as was the heart of <hi>David</hi> his father.</p>

               <p>Although the light of nature it ſelfe, and the word of God both teach us, that the life of the innocent is to be maintained; yet when another law of greater force commeth in, then this muſt giue place; for reaſon it<note place="margin">Why a Iudge muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to things proved.</note> ſelfe teacheth us, that a Iudge is to proceed according to things proved, otherwiſe juſtice could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, and the good of the whole, is to be preferred before the good of a private man.</p>

               <p>Secondly, If both the Parents were <hi>Iewes,</hi> and did not beget their children in wedlocke, then the children were ſecluded from the inheritance, <hi>Iudg. 11. 2. Thou ſhalt not inherite with us, becauſe thou art the ſonne of a ſtrange woman.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, If an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had married a bond-woman, then the children were ſecluded from the inheritance, although their fathers were free; thoſe who were borne of Handmaids were alwayes reputed ſervants; and God applyed this to Chriſt himſelfe as he was man, <hi>Eſay 49. 5.

So when a good Iudge giveth out a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:177234:54"/> wrong ſentence, the fault is not in the Iudge, but in the falſe witneſſes, who hold up a falſe light unto him, and therefore the Iudge ſhould labour to puniſh theſe falſe witneſſes, and to reſtore the partie who is wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to his right; and as <hi>Telephus</hi> was healed by the ſpeare that hurt him, ſo ſhould they ſtudie to cure the perſon whom they haue wounded by their ſentence.</p>
               <p>If a Iudge call two or three witneſſes, that is the firſt<note place="margin">A Iudge muſt not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without witneſſe.</note> thing required of him in tryall of the truth, <hi>nam teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio unius non proceditur,</hi> and one witnes doth not proue.

Thirdly, it could not be made meridionall, becauſe the Eaſt ſide &amp; the Weſt ſide are divided by the meridionall, and it wanteth the twelfth houre. Fourthly, it could not be made horizontall, becauſe they lay ſo neere the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall that the ſtyle could caſt no ſhadow.

Thirdly, this miracle was wrought in the Summer time, the day being at the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt; it could not be brought backe ten degrees in the winter day, for when the day is ſhorteſt, the Sunne ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to them at ſeven of the clocke: neither could this miracle be wrought at the Equinoctiall, for then they could not haue diſcerned the Sunne to caſt a ſhadow upon the diall, becauſe then the ſhadow is ſo long; but the Text ſaith, that the Sunne went backe ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees upon <hi>Ahaz</hi> diall, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. Therefore it ſeemes to haue beene wrought in the Summer time, at the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt day, when it was drawne backe from the eleventh houre to the ſixt, which is one houre after the Sunne riſing; for in the longeſt day it ariſeth to them at fiue of the clocke in the morning.</p>

                  <p>If the ſhadow had gone backe, and not the Sunne, the miracle had not beene ſo great, for when the Sunne <label type="milestone">

                     </label> goes forward naturally, the ſhadow goeth backward, now if the ſhadow had gone backe in an inſtant, and the Sunne ſtood ſtill, it had beene a miracle <hi>quoad modum,</hi>

When a lumpe of figges was layd to <hi>Hezekias</hi> boyle, the figges in time would haue matured this boyle, and broken it, but when the Lord doth it upon a ſuddaine, this is a miracle in the third degree. So for the ſhadow to goe backe when the Sunne goeth forward, this is naturall to it, but for the ſhadow to goe backe upon a ſuddaine, this was a miracle in the third degree, but when the Sunne and the ſhadow both went backe, this was a miracle in the firſt degree, <hi>&amp; quoad mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum &amp; quoad ſubſtantiam.</hi>

Theſe three things he was bound to doe <hi>jure propinquitatis,</hi> becauſe he was his neereſt kinſman.</p>
               <p>Now let us apply theſe to Chriſt our <hi>Goel,</hi> firſt our <hi>Goel,</hi> or <hi>vindex ſanguinis,</hi> the revenger of our bloud,<note place="margin">Chriſt our neereſt kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath taken all their priviledges upon him for us.</note> revengeth all our wrongs. <hi>When the heart of the reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the bloud was hot within him,</hi> Deut. 19. 6. it was a terrible thing for the manſlayer to meet him, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued eagerly after him. So Ieſus Chriſt purſueth after his enemies, who ſhed the bloud of his Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Goel</hi> redeemed the morgaged Land, <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 4. and <hi>Iere. 32. 7. Ieremie</hi> couſin to <hi>Hanameel</hi> redeemed his morgaged Land; we haue morgaged our inheritance in heaven, but our <hi>Goel</hi> Ieſus Chriſt, who is fleſh of our fleſh and bone of our bone, will redeeme it to us againe.</p>
               <p>The the third thing which the <hi>Goel</hi> did to his kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was to relieue him out of priſon. So we being condemned to that everlaſting priſon, Chriſt hath bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led us.</p>
               <p>Now the priviledges which the firſt-borne who was<note place="margin">The priviledges of the neereſt kinſman as he was firſt borne.</note> the <hi>Goel</hi> had done to him were two; Firſt he had the double portion of his Fathers goods; And ſecondly, his ſecond brother was bound to raiſe up ſeed to him.</p>

                  </note> the firſt ſerved for the ſolemnity of their contracts, &amp; it was called <hi>firmatoria diſcalceatio;</hi> the ſecond was for a puniſhment and diſgrace <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 9. And it differed from that which was uſed in confirmation in ſundry points.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when their ſhoe was taken off for a puniſhment <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Differ. </seg>1</label> or diſgrace, the woman herſelfe pulled off the ſhoe of him who refuſed to raiſe ſeed to his brother; but in the contract of confirmation the man himſelfe looſed his owne ſhoe and pulled it off.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that pulling off the ſhoe was for the diſgrace of the man; but this which was uſed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> was to ſecure the man in his right: it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ended to no diſgrace to him; or if he ſold the land, it was onely a ſigne that he was willing to quit his right; and if he bought the land it was a ſigne to him of his poſſeſſion.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that pulling off of the ſhoe was by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:177234:77"/> but this pulling off the ſhoe was by cuſtome. <hi>Ruth 4. 7. This was the manner in former times in Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, this ſhoe was pulled off from the naturall <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> brother, if he refuſed to raiſe up ſeed; but that ſhoe for confirmation was pulled off by any who made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, in token of poſſeſſion: And the Lord alludeth to this forme <hi>Pſal. 60. 8. Over Edom I will cast my ſhoe,</hi> that is, I will take poſſeſſion of it: this was called [<hi>Hhali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah</hi>]<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Fiftly, when the ſhoe was pulled off for diſgrace, it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> was given to no bodie, but the ſhoe which was pulled off in bargaining was given to him who bought the land.</p>
               <p>Sixtly, In the former pulling off of the ſhoe, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> was no requeſt made that the ſhoe ſhould be pulled off, but it was pulled off againſt his will; but in the latter, they deſired him to pull off his ſhoe, and he did it wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In the former the ſhoe was pulled off <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> againſt his will in the preſence of the Iudges; but in this bargaine the ſhoe might be pulled off before any ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Eightly, The former was onely pulled off when <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> the brother refuſed to raiſe up ſeed to his brother; but in the latter the ſhoe was pulled off in any contract of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, When they pulled off the ſhoe in diſgrace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> they ſpit in his face, which the <hi>Seventie</hi> tranſlate <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  </gap> to ſmite him in the face: but in this latter there was no ſuch diſgrace offered to the man.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, In the former when the ſhoe was pulled off, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> the woman ſaid, <hi>ſo ſhall it be done to the man who refuſeth to build his brothers houſe, Deut.</hi> 25. 9. but in the latter there were no ſuch words ſpoken.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, he that refuſeth to raiſe up ſeed to his brother <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:177234:77"/> his houſe was called <hi>domus diſcalceati</hi> in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but there followed no ſuch diſgrace to the man who pulled off his ſhoe in the contract.</p>
               <p>They make another difference to be this, that he who<note place="margin">The difference betwixt the naturall brother and the kinſman.</note> was the naturall brother, when he raiſed up ſeed to his brother, the children were not called his children, but his brothers children, and the ſhoe was pulled off his foot, becauſe he refuſed to doe that honour to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but when a couſin-german raiſed up ſeed to his kinſman, the children were not called after his kinſman that was dead, but as the father pleaſed to call them. <hi>Boaz</hi> called not his ſonne <hi>Machlon,</hi> after the firſt hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of <hi>Ruth,</hi> but <hi>Obed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the queſtion is, whether they were bound to <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                  </label> giue them the ſame names or not? For <hi>Deut.</hi> 25. 6. the words in the originall are theſe; <hi>Primogenitus quem pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererit ſtabit ſuper nomen fratris ſui, ſhall ſucceed in the name of his brother:</hi> therefore it may ſeeme they were called after the elder brothers name.</p>
               <p>To ſucceed in the name is to ſucceed in the place, and <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> not to be called after his name: and <hi>Ionathan</hi> paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, <hi>exurget in haereditate nomine fratris,</hi> to continue his name, but not to be called after his name.</p>
               <p>There were two ſorts of brothers amongſt the <hi>Iewes,</hi> naturall brethren and legall brethren; the naturall bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was bound to raiſe up ſeede to his eldeſt brother; the elder firſt, and if he died, then the ſecond, and then the third, &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. And if they did not, then they were puniſhed and diſgraced; but thoſe who were le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall brethren, or couſin-germanes, as <hi>N.</hi> was to <hi>Mach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> they were not compelled to marry them, but if they did not, there was ſome diſgrace put upon them, but not that great diſgrace which was put upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall brother. If a couſin-germane, or a legall brother had married his couſines wife, the children which he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:177234:78"/> begot upon her, were not called his children, but his couſines children; even as the children which the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall brother begat, were not his children but his elder brothers, and therefore <hi>N.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ruth 4. 6. I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme it, leſt I marre my owne inheritance;</hi> that is, theſe children begotten upon <hi>Ruth</hi> ſhould not be called my children, but my kinſmans, and ſo all that I inherite ſhould goe to them.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of this is; the Holy Ghoſt here mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <label type="milestone">

               <p>Our ſecond Priſon is the graue, <hi>Ionas</hi> was kept in the<note place="margin">The graue a ſtrong Priſon.</note> Whales belly with jawes and teeth; <hi>Peter</hi> was kept in the Priſon with foure quaternions of Souldiers; but man is kept within this Priſon with a more terrible guard, when the body is ſowne in corruption, in diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and in weakeneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 43. And oftentimes with ſinne the greateſt enemie of all, <hi>Iob</hi> 10. 11. their ſinnes lie downe in the duſt with them, that is, in the graue, this Priſon keepeth a man ſure.</p>
               <p>The laſt Priſon is that of the wicked in hell; man<note place="margin">Hell a terrible and fearefull Priſon.</note> when he dyeth is ſaid <hi>to returne to his owne earth.

But in this priſon the Lord is not with them, neither finde they any favour in the eyes of their Keeper; but as the Task-maiſters doubled the Taske upon the poore <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and were heavie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors over them, and ſaid daily to them, Get you to your burthens; ſo theſe fiends of hell are rigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actors over the wicked: <hi>Ieremie</hi> when he was in a deepe Priſon, yet he had <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> to intercede for him, <hi>Iere.</hi> 38. 7. but none doe intercede for the wicked. <hi>Peter</hi> was in a darke Priſon, yet the light did ſhine about him, his fetters fell off from him, &amp; the Angell led him forth, and ſet him free; But in hell, there is no light nor no redemption out of it.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of this is; as <hi>Ieremie</hi> prayed unto the <label type="milestone">

            <p>He was a rich man, and he is deſcribed by his cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>he was cloathed in purple and fine Linnen.</hi> He was cloathed in purple, this purple was the dye that was gotten from a ſhel-fiſh, and it is not knowne now in<note place="margin">Purple a coſtly dye.</note> thoſe parts of the world.</p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>Salomon</hi> when he was ſo gloriouſly dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, he was beholden to many creatures, he was behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to <hi>Egypt</hi> for his linnen, to the earth for his gold, to the ſilk-worme for his ſilke, to the ſhel-fiſh for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had nothing of his owne; ſo that if every one of thoſe ſhould haue claimed their own, he ſhould haue ſtood up like <hi>Aeſops</hi> Crow ſtript of all, when every one of the foules craved their own feathers which they had lent her; but looke to the Lillie which is beholden to no other for its beautie, doth not the Lillie then exceed <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glorie?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when <hi>Salomon</hi> was cloathed thus, it was but<note place="margin">Mans cloaths a note of his ſhame.</note> a remembrance to him of his fall, and he had as little cauſe to glory in theſe ornaments, as a theefe hath to glory in a ſrlken rope in which he is to be hanged, or if a man ſhould glorie in the plaiſter that covereth his wound; but the beautie of the Lillie is naturall, it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth not the ſhame of it, therefore the Lillie exceeded <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glorie.</p>
